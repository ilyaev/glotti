# What to Submit

- 📃 **Text Description** — Summary of the project's features and functionality, technologies used, any other data sources used, and your findings and learnings throughout the project.

- 👨‍💻 **URL to your Public Code Repository** — Let us see how you built it!
  - Include spin-up instructions in your `README` so judges can verify the project is reproducible.

- 🖥️ **Proof of Google Cloud Deployment** — Demonstrate that the backend is running on Google Cloud with a short recording (separate from your demo). Accepted formats:
  1. A quick screen recording showing the behind-the-scenes of your app running on GCP (e.g., console logs or a deployment view), **or**
  2. A link to a code file in your repo that demonstrates use of Google Cloud services and APIs (e.g., API calls to Vertex AI endpoints).

- 🏗️ **Architecture Diagram** — A clear visual representation of your system (e.g., how Gemini connects to your backend, database, and frontend).
  > **Pro tip:** Add this to the file upload or image carousel so it's easy for judges to find!

- 📹 **Demonstration Video** — Under 4 minutes. Must:
  - Demo your multimodal/agentic features working in real-time (no mockups).
  - Pitch your project: what problem did you solve and what value does your solution bring?
